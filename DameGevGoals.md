This document contains suggestions to improved methods for the development of Pivot and our future games.

## A New Software Methodology 

We need to incorporate a ruleset for how we develop and follow it. So far, what we have done is to plan
a base idea for the game and follow uncertain requirements. Every once in a while we come up with new ideas
for the game and software design which some of us will either agree or disagree on, then possibly implement it.

This cycle is closely related to **Extreme Programming** (XP), a software methodology based on mixing development and
design into given iterations. This is by no means a negative sign. In fact, it fits very well for a small team
that consist of students such as ourselves. XP does have its problems in my opinion, since it is designed for 
professional businesses, so I will instead try to design a methodology that works well for us while still 
maintaining the goal of XP.

### The Team Members

We must recognize what we are best at and assign each of ourselves a role. I want to mainly focus on learning
what a game development team consists of and then apply that logic to us in a fair and consistent manner.

The important thing in assigning each of us a role is to utilize each of our specializations to
lead in each of our own fields. This is no different from what we currently do. However, I believe we all have 
much more potential in many more things than just programming, music and pixel art. In addition, many of the 
roles are going to apply to all of us in order to keep game design ideas fair. 

Before I give an example of a role assignment to myself (it's not set in stone), I want to clarify that a project
manager is key here. A project manager in our case would be someone who manages goals and deadlines. A project
manager should also manage requirements, but I didn't mention it since we are all specialists in each of our
roles. So, requirements should always be suggested to the project manager.

This link doesn't cover this topic, but lists a bunch of different game dev team roles we should consider:

Now to name an example: myself. I could take upon myself the following roles:
 * Gameplay Programmer
 * Core Engine Programmer
 * Lead Code Designer (I just made that one up but you know what I mean xD)
 * Release Engineer
 * Tools Programmer
 
Notice how the last two roles I put on myself could apply to all three programmers on our team. I assigned
myself those two to show that each role can overlap, so keep that in mind.  

We need to come to an agreement on who responsible for what job in order to create a proper software methodology
for ourselves so that we can manage each job as well. I also want to point out that there are still a sizable
amount of roles that will overlap, such as level designer, systems designer and gameplay designer. We need to 
discuss this further. 

### Iterative design and development

An important thing in the creation of any project is resource management. Since we will take upon ourselves a 
large amount of roles and specializations, we need a proper way to ...
